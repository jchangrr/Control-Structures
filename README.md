# Control-Structures
Problem 1:
Prompt the user to enter in 3 points on a standard Cartesian coordinate plane. You can assume the user will enter these values as floating point numbers.
Compute the distance between each points - you will be computing 3 distance values.
Report the distance to the user of each side, rounded to 2 decimal places
Next, determine if the three points could form a valid triangle. 
If the triangle is valid, report whether it is an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle.

Problem 2:
Write a program that lets the user guess an integer between 1 and 10. The integer should be randomly selected by your program when it starts up. Your player is allowed to guess three times - if they guess correctly, they win and the program ends. If they guess incorrectly they should be told if the number they guessed was too high or too low and then be asked to guess another time. At the end of the program you should display the secret number as well as how many attempts it took to guess that number.

Problem 3: For this assignment you will be writing a "diagnostic" program that will be able to tell a user whether s/he has our class on any given day during the current semester. The program should begin by asking the user to supply a date in the following format: YYYYMMDD For example, 20200218 would be interpreted as "February 18th, 2020". You can always assume that the user will supply an 8 digit integer. Next, the program should "diagnose" the date as one of the following:

The date is invalid (i.e. 20205701 is invalid because there is no 57th month of the year, 20010931 is invalid because there are not 30 days in the month of September). Note that for the purpose of the basic version of the program February will always have 28 days
The date is before the beginning of the semester (before January 27th, 2020)
The date is after the end of the semester (after May 11th, 2020)
The date is during the semester AND is one of the days that we have class (see our class schedule to the left for a complete list of days - note that each class should use its own schedule)
The date is during the semester AND Is NOT one of the days that we have class

Your program can assume that the user will type in an integer.
